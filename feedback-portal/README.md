The Feedback portal is a simple application the pulls feedback from the [Feedback API](https://github.com/patrickbrandt/fullstory-demo/tree/master/api). Results are ordered with the most recent feedback at the top of the list. Feedback can be filtered by sentiment categories.

The portal we built with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
