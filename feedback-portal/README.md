### [http://wpb.is/FeedbackPortal](https://wpb.is/FeedbackPortal)
The Feedback portal is a simple application that displays user-entered feedback from the [Feedback API](https://github.com/patrickbrandt/fullstory-demo/tree/master/api). Results are listed with the most recent feedback at the top of the list. Feedback can be filtered by sentiment categories.

Feedback is entered via the feedback widget on the [FullStory demo homesite](https://wpb.is/FullStory).

The portal was built with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
